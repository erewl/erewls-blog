Hi, my name is Katrin but in a lot of cases I also go by the username erewl.

I am a software engineer that is currently working in the Energy Sector with the programming language Scala.
I discovered Scala by accident in my previous job when I got to work on a project in the tourism sector that was according to my sources supposed to be written in Java. Psych! I am a Scala developer now (for as long as the contract goes).
Turns out I enjoy writing software in Scala way more than Java which ultimately (apart from some other reasons) led me applying for a "real" Scala-Job. 
So in summary, finding out about this functional and object-oriented prgramming language was a little happy accident I don't regret so far.

Apart from IT stuff I also enjoy making and creating art and music (doesn't mean I am good at it!), climbing and occassionally gaming.
So I might blog about those topics as well. I haven't really figured out the scope of this blog.
