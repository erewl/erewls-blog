Hi! And welcome to my very first blog post.
I have been struggling to start writing a blog for a long time for various reasons. I could list all reasons, however, thinking about it they all boil down to one main problem:

**Scio me nescire** - I know that I know nothing.

The more I learn and the more I read, the more I also realize there is always more to learn, to read, to create...

Ultimately I try to convince myself those things don't matter too much.  That's just life.
During my time working as a software engineer I noticed, that it helps a lot for me to learn and understand a topic if I do this with the purpose of preparing to share my knowledge, through a talk, a meeting and similar.

So this first blog post is really just for me to internalize what I try to teach myself for years and push my doubts away.

*It is okay if it sucks, I just do it for myself.*

Let's live by the words of the famous Shia Laboeuf and *just do it*.
